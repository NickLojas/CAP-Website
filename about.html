			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Bozena Tutaj. For over 20 years, I have been providing counselling and psychotherapy to individuals, couples and families dealing with emotional and behavioural problems, trauma, relationship difficulties, parenting issues and family breakdown. I am registered with the College of Registered Psychotherapists of Ontario and I am a member of the Ontario Association of Counsellors, Consultants, Psychometrists and Psychotherapists. I received my Masterâ€™s Degree in Psychology in Krakow, Poland, in Jagiellonian University which is one of the most reputable universities in Europe. From the time when my degree was recognized by the University of Toronto, I have helped many clients with various issues and challenges. I am committed to providing the very best support
			possible, in a comfortable setting and personalized to the client's needs and circumstances. Each client is unique in all aspects but equally important and equally deserving my attention, time and energy. My clients have said to me that they always feel heard,
			understood, validated, respected and supported. I truly care about the person in front of me and I always go above and beyond in taking care of their needs. In my approach, I combine caring and empathetic attitude with honesty, transparency and direct communication
			with clients. <br>
			I strongly believe in the importance of lifelong education and ongoing professional development. This is why, despite my long experience in the mental health field, I constantly enhance my knowledge of evidence-based or evidence-informed methods and approaches.
