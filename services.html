			<h1>Services</h1>
			<p>
				I provide a wide range of treatment services including solution focused brief therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), narrative therapy, schema therapy, emotional focused therapy, mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and trauma-informed cognitive behavioral therapy. In my practice, some of my clients come with a diagnosis from a physician, psychiatrist or psychologist. Some clients receive psychotherapy services for non-diagnosed conditions, e.g. self-esteem issues, stress, extensive anger, trauma, relationship issues, parenting, etc. Those clients who are in need of a clear mental health or medical diagnosis will be referred to a designated professional for that purpose. <br><br>

				Through providing a safe and supportive environment and using a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches, I will help you identify changes you want to achieve in your life and relationships, explore past experiences and feelings that keep you “stuck”, gain insight into your needs, emotions and patterns of behavior, and develop skills and tools to move towards a healthier, more satisfying life. <br><br>

				I offer a free, brief, in-person consultation with no commitment for anyone interested in discussing the process of counselling/ psychotherapy. A consultation is your opportunity to clarify your needs and goals and to find out if I am the right fit for you. It is not a therapy session. It lasts 30 minutes, which typically gives me enough time to assess your situation and provide you with a brief feedback. It also gives you an opportunity to ask questions, discuss the process of counselling/psychotherapy and discuss scheduling of our sessions, fees, and related matters.
